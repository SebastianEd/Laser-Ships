<h3>Laser-Ships</h3>

***

<p style="color: blue;">This Projrect is supposed to be a simple 2D Side-Scroll spaceshooter developed with C++ and the SDL 2.0!</p>
<p style="color: blue;">There's nothing to see at all, but you can add animated sprites and move the player with the arrow keys now.</p>

<p>IDE: Visual Studio 2017</p>
